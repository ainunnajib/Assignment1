The Shiny App that works
========================================================

Today I'd like to present a Shiny App that works.  

The URL for the app is at:    
**https://ainunnajib.shinyapps.io/Assignment1/**

What's in the app
========================================================
The Shiny App will display for you:
- Histogram
- Mean
- Median  
  
based on variable at your choice interactively

Histogram
========================================================
for example, histogram of mpg  
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](presentation-figure/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png) 

Mean & Median
========================================================
for example, mean & median of mpg:

```r
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```

```
[1] 20.09062
```

```r
median(mtcars$mpg)
```

```
[1] 19.2
```
